Describe the problem
--------------------
What do you see happening? What do you think should happen? (Note that many LLVM operations will simply trigger an assertion if you pass the wrong arguments to them. This is known to be a pain.)


Describe the platform you are using
-----------------------------------
llvmtcl is very dependent on the platform it is built and running on. Please describe it reasonably accurately.

llvmtcl is also dependent on the versions of Tcl and LLVM that you are using. Please describe them. (If you're on MacOS, remember to also describe how you acquired Tcl and LLVM. Are you using the system versions, have you installed them with a third-party package manager such as MacPorts or HomeBrew, or have you built your own versions directly from source? _This is known to be able to affect the build._)
