'llvmtcl' is a Tcl extension making the LLVM C API available from Tcl.

Requirements:

- tcl 8.5
- llvm 2.7

Supported platfroms:

- Linux

Building llvmtcl: 

- Adjust the following settings in the Makefile:

  TCLDIR = Directory in which Tcl was installed
  TCLLIB = Path of Tcl library to be linked against
  TCLSH = Path to Tcl shell

  LLVMDIR = Directory in which LLVM was installed

  CFLAGS = Optional compiler flags

- Run make to generate the extension

  % make

- Add the LLVM lib directory containing the LLVM shared object files to the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable

Using llvmtcl:

- to load the extension into a Tcl interpreter:

  package require llvmtcl

- all commands are added to the llvmtcl namespace and can be imported:

  namespace import llvmtcl::*

- llvmtcl command names and arguments are taken from the C API as found in the
  llvm include file llvm-c/Core.h. Commands taking a pointer and a number of
  elements as arguments have been converter taking a Tcl list as argument.

Examples:

- test.tcl
- test2.tcl
- tebc.tcl
